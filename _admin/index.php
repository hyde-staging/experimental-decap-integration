/**
 * The HydePHP CMS Admin Panel Router
 *
 * This file is the main entry point for the HydePHP CMS Admin Panel.
 *
 * It serves as a simple router for the static admin panel, allowing us to inject
 * HydePHP configuration data into the admin panel's configuration data.
 *
 * To start the admin server, run the following command from your project root:
 * > php -S localhost:3000 /_admin/index.php # The port can be changed
 *
 * Next, visit http://localhost:3000/admin in your web browser.
